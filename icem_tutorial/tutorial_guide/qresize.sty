%
%
% INTRO
%
%   This is a fairly simple file, so I am not going to bother with a
%   .dtx file.  Here is the whole documentation, right here. :-)  No
%   \docstrip{} hastle or anything...
%
%
% WHY THIS PACKAGE?
%
%   I think the default printable area used by \LaTeX{}, frankly,
%   sucks.  When I turn in three problem assignments for a math class
%   and it takes up eight pages, there is just too much blank space.
%   So, I hacked the relevant parts out of |classes.dtx| which deal
%   with setting printable area and balancing margins and fiddled with
%   some of the default values.  Not only that, but it is easily
%   customisable.
%
%
% HOW TO USE THIS PACKAGE
%
%   There are two basic ways to use this package.  Essentially, after
%   including the package, the macro |\resize| is available to the
%   user.  After altering any of the relevant page information, one
%   can invoke |\resize| to recalculate page margins.  |\resize|
%   should be called after changes to the following:
%
%       \textheight        \headheight        \footskip
%       \textwidth         \headsep
%
%   and optionally after changing |\topskip|.  These are the
%   dimensions on which the \LaTeX{} algorithms below depend.
%
%   This only half solves the problem, though.  Having to change the
%   height and width in every document is also not a particularly
%   ducky solution, so there is also a package option, namely |auto|.
%   In commented sections below, you will see where I have altered
%   some of the default values that \LaTeX{} uses for page layout
%   calculations.  Invoking the package with the |auto| option will
%   automatically do a resize with these defaults.  Of course, the
%   |\resize| command will still be available if further modifications 
%   are desired.  You should feel perfectly free to change these
%   defaults to something that will be more appropriate for you.
%   As the major advantage of \LaTeX's default, \emph{wide} margins is
%   the availability of |\marginpar| space, for draft annotations, I
%   also consider the revised margins of this package to be applicable
%   to final output.  Therefore the option |final| will be grabbed and
%   interpreted to mean the same thing as |auto|.
%
%
% BUGS
%
%   Well, I wouldn't call this a bug, but I haven't accounted for the
%   slight differences in these calculations specific to the |book|
%   class's options for size switching.  This package was written in
%   about twenty minutes, and I couldn't think of a way off the type
%   of my head to test for the invoked class.  If there is one (and
%   I'm fairly sure there is), please let me know.

%   If you have any, send them to me at one of the e-mail addresses
%   above.  I hope this will be useful to somebody, somewhere.

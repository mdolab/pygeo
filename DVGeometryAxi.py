class DVGeometryAxi(DVGeometry):
    """
    A class for manipulating geometry. 
    
    The purpose of the DVGeometry class is to provide a mapping from
    user-supplied design variables to an arbitrary set of discrete,
    three-dimensional coordinates. These three-dimensional coordinates
    can in general represent anything, but will typically be the
    surface of an aerodynamic mesh, the nodes of a FE mesh or the
    nodes of another geometric construct. 

    In a very general sense, DVGeometry performs two primary
    functions:

    1. Given a new set of design variables, update the
       three-dimensional coordinates: :math:`X_{DV}\\rightarrow
       X_{pt}` where :math:`X_{pt}` are the coordinates and :math:`X_{DV}`
       are the user variables. 

    2. Determine the derivative of the coordinates with respect to the
       design variables. That is the derivative :math:`\\frac{dX_{pt}}{dX_{DV}}`
    
    DVGeometry uses the *Free-Form Deformation* approach for goemetry
    manipulation. The basic idea is the coordinates are *embedded* in
    a clear-flexible jelly-like block. Then by stretching moving and
    'poking' the volume, the coordinates that are embedded inside move
    along with overall deformation of the volume. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    fileName : str
       filename of FFD file. This must be a ascii formatted plot3D file
       in fortran ordering. 
    center : array, size (3,1)
            The center about which the axisymmetric FFD should be applied.
            This can be any point along the rotation axis of the body
    collapse_into: 2-tuple of strings
            Two coordinate axes that you wish to collapse your points into. 
            This should align with the directions you are moving FFD 
            control points. The first item in the tuple is taken as the rotation 
            axis for the axi-symmetric coordinate system. So ("x","z") means to 
            collapse into the x,z plane and use x as the rotational axis. 
            ("z", "x") means to collapse into the x,z plane and use z as the 
            rotational axis
    complex : bool
        Make the entire object complex. This should **only** be used when
        debugging the entire tool-chain with the complex step method. 

    child : bool
        Flag to indicate that this object is a child of parent DVGeo object


    Examples
    --------
    The general sequence of operations for using DVGeometry is as follows::
      >>> from pygeo import DVGeometryAxi
      >>> DVGeo = DVGeometryAxi('FFD_file.fmt', center=(0., 0., 0.), collapse_into=("x", "z"))
      >>> # Embed a set of coordinates Xpt into the object
      >>> DVGeo.addPointSet(Xpt, 'myPoints')
      >>> # Associate a 'reference axis' for large-scale manipulation
      >>> DVGeo.addRefAxis('wing_axis', axis_curve)
      >>> # Define a global design variable function:
      >>> def twist(val, geo):
      >>>    geo.rot_z['wing_axis'].coef[:] = val[:]
      >>> # Now add this as a global variable:
      >>> DVGeo.addGeoDVGlobal('wing_twist', 0.0, twist, lower=-10, upper=10)
      >>> # Now add local (shape) variables
      >>> DVGeo.addGeoDVLocal('shape', lower=-0.5, upper=0.5, axis='y')
      >>>

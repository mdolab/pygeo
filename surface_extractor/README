Readme for surface_extractor

This is a small utility for extracting wall surfaces from CGNS files.
It converts them to a surface plot3d file that can be directly used in 
pyGeo.

The scope of the program is fairly limited...it will only work on structured
3D grids. The default boundary condition name for extraction is "BCWallViscous"
however, this can be changed as necessary. (modify line ~78) 

It has only been tested with ifort and gfortran.

CGNS Linking
The program requires the use of the CGNSlibrary. If cgnslib_f.h isn't in path where
the compiler can find you must include its directory. The same goes for the libcgns.

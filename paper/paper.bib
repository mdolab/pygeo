  abstract = {The second-generation of supersonic civil transport has to match ambitious targets in terms of efficiency to be economically and environmentally viable. CFD-based design optimization offers a powerful approach to address the complex tradeoffs intrinsic to this novel configuration. We apply this approach to the design of airfoils and wings at both supersonic cruise conditions and lower-speed, off-design conditions. We perform single and multipoint optimization to minimize the drag over an ideal supersonic aircraft flight envelope and assess the influence of physical and numerical parameters on optimization accuracy and robustness. To obtain more favorable design tradeoffs between different flight regimes, we introduce morphing leading and trailing edge capabilities, and quantify their benefits against fixed-wing shapes. The optimized layouts outperform baseline supersonic reference designs over a range of flight conditions, with drag reductions from 4% up to 86% for
              airfoils, and between 24% and 74% reductions relative to a reference wing. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables the fast and effective design of highly-efficient wings, capturing non-intuitive tradeoffs, and offering more in-depth physical insight into the optimal layouts.}

Composites, even with state-of-the-art coatings, are susceptible to cavitation erosion damage. This work aims to design a cavitation-free composite lifting surface to maximize efficiency while ensuring structural integrity. We optimize a canonical hydrofoil using a gradient-based optimization framework that couples a Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes solver with a finite-element structural solver. The optimization reduces the weighted drag coefficient by 1.2% over lift coefficients between 0.2 and 0.6, and increases the cavitation inception speed by 82% at the nominal condition compared to the baseline. The optimized design shows higher cavitation inception speeds than an Eppler hydrofoil (E1127, known for cavitation-free operation at moderate lift conditions) with the same baseline planform at CL >= 0.2. The improvement from the E1127 hydrofoil was due mostly
              to delaying tip vortex cavitation induced by 3-D effects. The optimization finds the fiber angle to balance the bend-twist coupling and modifies the directional strength to reduce the susceptibility to excessive deformation and material failure when sweep presents.}

The reduction of the levelized cost of energy is a critical step to expand the application of carbon-free technologies that rely on high-potential, renewable energy sources such as wind power. Advanced computational tools are instrumental to capturing the tightly-coupled, multi-physics interactions that characterize modern highly-flexible wind turbine rotors. In this work, we use our high-fidelity multidisciplinary design optimization software to perform aerostructural optimization studies of a large wind turbine configuration, using an efficient, highly-scalable, gradient-based approach on a coupled CFD/FEM model. We investigate the trade-offs between steady-state aerodynamic efficiency and structural cost of a benchmark rotor using more than 100 structural and geometric design variables. Mass and torque are
               simultaneously used as performance metrics as we constrain the maximum stress and tip displacement of the rotor at below-rated operating conditions. We discuss both the optimized design features and the general design trends in the form of Pareto front analyses as we sweep over different prescribed torque values and objective weights. The results highlight the benefits of the coupled model with respect to a single-discipline strategy and showcase the additional insight that high-fidelity analysis tools offer to designers. As we work towards a more refined structural model and the inclusion of a larger set of shape variables to extend the optimization capabilities of the tool, the results support the idea that such high-fidelity approaches can complement conventional low-fidelity tools in the design of light and efficient turbine blades.}

    abstract    = {The wind energy industry relies heavily on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyze new turbine designs. To utilize CFD earlier in the design process, where lower-fidelity methods such as blade element momentum (BEM) are more common, requires the development of new tools. Tools that utilize numerical optimization are particularly valuable because they reduce the reliance on design by trial and error. We present the first comprehensive 3-D CFD adjoint-based shape optimization of a modern 10 MW offshore wind turbine. The optimization problem is aligned with a case study from International Energy Agency (IEA) Wind Task 37, making it possible to compare our findings with the BEM results from this case study and therefore allowing us to determine the value of design optimization based on high-fidelity models. The comparison shows that the overall design trends suggested by the two models do agree, and that it is particularly valuable to consult the high-fidelity
                  model in areas such as root and tip where BEM is inaccurate. In addition, we compare two different CFD solvers to quantify the effect of modeling compressibility and to estimate the accuracy of the chosen grid resolution and order of convergence of the solver. Meshes up to 14×10^6 cells are used in the optimization whereby flow details are resolved. The present work shows that it is now possible to successfully optimize modern wind turbines aerodynamically under normal operating conditions using Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models. The key benefit of a 3-D RANS approach is that it is possible to optimize the blade planform and cross-sectional shape simultaneously, thus tailoring the shape to the actual 3-D flow over the rotor. This work does not address evaluation of extreme loads used for structural sizing, where BEM-based methods have proven very accurate, and therefore will likely remain the method of choice.

    abstract    = {Hydrogen has been identified as a potential fuel for air transportation without carbon emissions. Hydrogen contains much higher energy per unit mass than any conceivable rechargeable battery, potentially making longer-range missions possible than pure electric configurations. However, hydrogen's low volumetric energy density presents practical challenges. Hydrogen must either be kept under deep cryogenic conditions or compressed under very high pressure. Either solution is likely to require adding significant drag and tank weight to the airplane. This is a packing optimization problem subject to aerostructural physics, and we can employ multidisciplinary design optimization techniques to provide insight into optimal wing design for novel hydrogen aircraft concepts. In this paper, we extend prior work on wing packing optimization subject to aerodynamics only, and now incorporate structural analysis and structure geometry into the problem. We optimize the range of a
                  hydrogen-electric aircraft with hydrogen fuel storage located inside the wing outer mold line. The geometry of the hydrogen storage tanks influences the shape of the wing as well as the weight and volumetric capacity of the tank. While the effect of hydrogen storage on other aircraft concepts cannot be generalized from this study, the optimization methods we use are promising for performing relevant aircraft design trade studies. The optimizer finds the correct tradeoff between weight, drag, and fuel storage for the mission, subject to spatial integration feasibility. In our test scenario, we find that the optimal aerostructural design involves substantial wing root thickening.}

NASA's Single-aisle Turboelectric Aircraft with Aft Boundary-Layer propulsion (STARC-ABL) concept employs BLI on an electrically powered tail cone thruster to take advantage of the technology on what is otherwise a conventional airframe. Despite the traditional airframe of this concept, aeropropulsive integration is critical to the BLI propulsor's performance. Therefore, it is vital to employ tightly coupled aeropropulsive models to design BLI systems. In this work, 3-D RANS simulations are used to model the aerodynamics, and 1-D thermodynamic cycle analyses are used to model the propulsion system. The two models are tightly coupled using NASA's OpenMDAO framework, enabling efficient design optimization through gradient-based optimization with analytic derivatives. Using this coupled aeropropulsive framework, 18 computational
                  fluid dynamics (CFD)-based aeropropulsive design optimizations are performed to study the power requirements of the BLI configuration and a reference podded configuration where the electric fan ingests freestream air. This study provides the first set of CFD-based performance data for the STARC-ABL concept across the design space of BLI fan size and pressure ratio. The results quantify the power savings through BLI compared to a traditional propulsion system.}

Emerging categories of aircraft, such as electric aircraft, are likely to experience new and critical spatial integration challenges.Existingaerodynamic shape optimization toolsuse anarrowly defined setof geometric constraints. However, no known aerodynamic optimization framework can handle spatial integration constraints derived directly from three-dimensional (3-D) geometry. A general geometric constraint formulation based on triangulated 3-D geometry is proposed. The constraint consists of two metrics: the length of the intersection curve(s) between any two objects, and the Kreisselmeier--Steinhauser function aggregated minimum distance. The proposed implementation of the intersection and distance computations is fast and analytically
                  differentiable with respect to geometric design variables, making it suitable for efficient gradient-based optimization. The constraint formulation is validated using three Reynoldsaveraged Navier--Stokes-based aerodynamic shape optimization problems: a 2-D fairing design problem, a 3-D fairing design problem, and the design of an aeroshell to surround a human avatar. It is shown that this approach is robust and efficient, enabling the aerodynamic optimization of bodies containing objects with arbitrary shapes.}

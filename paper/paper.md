# Summary
In aerodynamic shape optimization, an optimization algorithm modifies a body's geometry to improve its performance.
A common shape optimization example is adjusting the external shape of an aircraft wing to minimize the aerodynamic drag computed via computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) couples multiple disciplines, such as aerodynamics and structural mechanics, to optimize them simultaneously, which is usually more advantageous than optimizing only a single discipline.
In such cases, the geometry must be represented consistently across multiple disciplines.

pyGeo is a geometry package for three-dimensional shape manipulation tailored for aerodynamic and multidisciplinary design optimization.
It provides basic geometry generation capabilities, several methods for geometry parameterization, numerous geometric constraints, and utility functions for geometry manipulation.
The code computes derivatives for all parameterization methods and constraint functions, enabling gradient-based optimization.
<!--MM: I am team parameTRIzation-->

# Features

## Integrations

pyGeo was originally developed to implement and use free-form deformation (FFD) to manipulate 3D geometries in CFD-based optimization [@Kenway2010b].
The "Free-form Deformation" section describes this implementation and recent extensions in more detail. 

pyGeo is the geometry manipulation engine within the MDO of Aircraft Configurations at High Fidelity (MACH) framework [@Kenway2014a], [@Kenway2014c], which specializes in high-fidelity aerostructural optimization.
pyGeo, together with the other core MACH modules, is integrated into MPhys[^1], a more general MDO framework for high-fidelity multiphysics problems built on the even more general OpenMDAO framework [@Gray2019a].

[^1]: https://github.com/OpenMDAO/mphys

Both MACH and MPhys use pyOptSparse [@Wu2020a] to interface with optimization algorithms.
<!-- HMH: I think <both frameworks> here referred to the frameworks pyGeo is directly integrated into -->
pyGeo passes design variables and constraints to pyOptSparse directly, reducing user effort.

pyGeo's interface for design variables and constraints is independent of which discipline solvers are accessing the geometry.
This means that pyGeo geometries can interact with different types of solvers, such as structures and aerodynamics, in the same way.
This also allows direct comparison of the behavior or performance of two different solvers within the same discipline using the same geometric parameterization for each, such as two different flow solvers [@Adler2022c].

## Geometry Generation

pyGeo can create simple geometries in the IGES file format, a common type readable by computer-aided design (CAD) tools.
One method to generate a surface geometry in pyGeo lofts a series of user-specified cross-sections.
This lofting is commonly used to create a wing from airfoil cross-sections (\autoref{fig:geo_gen}).
Rounded or pinched wingtip geometries can be generated quickly.
The method relies on the open-source package pySpline[^2], which handles the underlying B-spline implementation.

![Example of a wing generated with pyGeo and the airfoil used for its cross-sections.\label{fig:geo_gen}](geo_gen.pdf)

<!-- % [ ] TODO JM-: In the 3D figure, highlight the airfoils used in the lofting in red? In the airfoil figure, eliminate blank space. Eliminate grid lines?  -->
<!-- HMH: I will redo the figure -->

## Geometry Parameterization with pyGeo


pyGeo contains several options for parameterizing geometry: variations on the FFD method, interfaces to external parametric modeling tools, and an analytic parameterization.
<!-- HMH: I added <interfaces to> back in because while we directly include the FFD methods, we do not directly include VSP/ESP -->
Because each of these parameterizations uses a common interface for interacting with the rest of the MACH framework, any parameterization can be used in place of another within an optimization setup.
The choice of parameterization depends on the user's experience, the geometry details, and whether the user needs the final design in a specific format.

<!-- MM: Should we include a list of modules/classes here for easier reference later on?-->

### Free-form Deformation
<!--
TODO:
- talk less about FFDs and more about capabilities
- ref axis and complex geometric operations for a wing
- [x] child FFD
- [x] multi FFD
- [x] redo planform DV picture to be less pixelated
- [x] ESP pic
- [x] VSP pic
- [] other pic?
-->
The free-form deformation (FFD) method [@Sederberg1986] is one of the most popular three-dimensional geometry parameterization approaches.
This approach embeds the entire reference geometry in a parameterized volume. 
The set of control points that determine the shape of the volume are displaced to manipulate the points inside. 
<!--JLA: The control points do not have to be (and often are not) on the surface of the embedding volume -->
The user can have a high degree of control over the geometry by selecting different control point densities and locations.

Individual control points can be moved to obtain local shape modifications.
In pyGeo, these are referred to as _local_ design variables because a single control point is affected.
Conversely, it is also common to define geometric operations involving a collection of control points across the entire FFD block.
These are referred to as _global_ design variables in pyGeo.
For example, twist variables can be defined as rotations of the control points about a reference axis that runs along the wing. <!-- MM: this is a good example but I feel we need to specify what twist is to a non-aerospace audience-->

\autoref{fig:FFD_DV} shows a few common planform design variables for an aircraft wing.
Parameterizations based on the singular value decomposition are also possible [@Wu2022b].
<!-- talk about ref axis more? -->

<!-- Compared to other parameterizations, the FFD method has several key advantages.
Since the entire geometry is embedded, there is no need to start with or reverse-engineer a parametric geometry representation as commonly done with B-spline-based methods, where a least-squares fit is needed to generate a B-spline surface representation.
Rather than parameterizing the geometry directly, the geometric _deformation_ is parameterized instead.
This decoupling of geometry definition from geometric deformation allows for control and refinement of the deformation independently of the original geometry.
When working with multiple geometries, for example, an optimization involving an aerodynamic and structural surface simultaneously, both surfaces can be embedded into the same FFD volume.
Because the same volume would manipulate both surfaces, coincident surfaces remain coincident after deformations, and this approach ensures consistency between disparate geometries. -->

![Examples of common wing planform design variables.\label{fig:FFD_DV}](ffd_dvs.pdf)

In addition to the basic FFD implementation, pyGeo offers two additional features: hierarchical FFD and multi-component FFD.

#### Hierarchical FFD
<!-- HMH: changing to child FFD - plural child FFDs -->
<!--MM: not sold on the subsection titles I made, pls provide input-->
<!--SS: Changed subsections from 'Child FFD' to 'Hierarchical FFD' and 'Multi-FFD' to 'Multi-component FFD'. Also using 'FFD blocks' instead of 'FFDs'. -->
FFD objects can be organized in a hierarchical structure within pyGeo.
Dependent, "child" FFD blocks can be embedded in the main, "parent" FFD block to enable modifications on a subset of the full geometry.
<!-- The user can define local and global variables on both objects independently.-->
<!--  HMH: do we explain the difference between local and global variables somewhere?-->
pyGeo first propagates the parent deformations to both the geometry and the child control points and then propagates the deformations of the child control points to their subset of the geometry. <!--MM: I would like to double check this sentence with Anil-->
One of the advantages of using this approach is that each FFD block can have its own independent reference axis to be used for global design variables such as rotations and scaling.
This has facilitated the definition of independent leading and trailing edge wing deformations [@Mangano2021a], wind turbine blade parametrization [@Mangano2022a],[@Madsen2019a], and hydrofoil design [@Liao2021a].
\autoref{fig:ffd_child} from the latter paper shows a case where the parent FFD block is used to scale the chord of a hydrofoil using a reference axis at the trailing edge, whereas the twist and sweep variables are defined on the child FFD block with its reference axis at the quarter-chord.

![Example of parametrization through parent-child FFD blocks [@Liao2021a] \label{fig:ffd_child}](ffd_child.png)

<!-- [ ] TODO JM-: "blocks" of "volumes". Be consistent throughout and define clearly when first mentioned -->

#### Multi-component FFD

The basic FFD implementation lacks flexibility when the geometry has intersecting components.
In such cases, pyGeo can parameterize each component using FFD and ensure a watertight surface representation at the component intersections using an inverse-distance surface deformation method [@Yildirim2021b].
This method relies on the open-source pySurf package [@Secco2018b] to compute intersections between components, perform projections, and remesh curves.
\autoref{fig:ffd_multi} shows an example of a component-based FFD setup for a supersonic transport aircraft.

![Example of FFD parameterization with intersecting components [@Seraj2022a]. \label{fig:ffd_multi}](ffd_multi.png)

<!-- % [x] TODO JM-: show the other side of the geometry for aesthetics, like Fig. 6? But without the FFD? -->
<!-- SS: Done. -->

### Parametric Geometry Tools

The flexibility and ease of setup of the FFD method make it preferable for some applications.
In other applications, however, it is beneficial to define the geometry in a more commonly accepted engineering format, such as a CAD model or other parametric definition.
For example, a CAD model is usually required to manufacture a design.

<!-- [X] TODO SS-HMH: If we are looking to cut text, this paragraph could be a candidate. I think one line making the point that FFD defines the deformation, whereas CAD directly defines the geometry would be sufficient. -->
<!-- [X] TODO SS-HMH: 'designed parametrically or 'defined parametrically' ? -->
If the geometry is defined parametrically, the relationships between design variables and geometry are defined in the model itself.
An FFD block only handles deformations, while parametric geometry tools directly define the geometry.
<!-- In an FFD model of a box, for example, the FFD points could represent the four corners of the box, but then the user would be required to define the planes in which points move to change the length, width, and height of the box.
In a parametric modeling tool, the user would create a box by defining its initial length, width, and height.
In either case, the length, width, and height (or a subset) can be controlled in the optimization process as design variables. -->

<!-- [X] TODO SS-HMH: The transition here is a bit abrupt without any introduction to what ESP and OpenVSP are. -->
pyGeo contains interfaces to two parametric geometry tools, the Engineering Sketch Pad (ESP) [@Haimes2013a] and OpenVSP [@McDonald2022a].
ESP is a CAD software, while OpenVSP is a conceptual design tool.
The two packages have different capabilities, but both directly define the geometry with design variables, and the created geometry can be used in external analysis tools.

<!-- [X] TODO SS-HMH: There is enough repeated text between the ESP and OpenVSP sections that we might want to describe both under 'Parametric Geometry Tools' rather than have separate subsections. -->
pyGeo interfaces with ESP and OpenVSP in similar ways.
In both cases, pyGeo takes an instance of the model and its points are associated with coordinates in a mesh from a solver in the MACH framework.
<!-- [ ] TODO JM-: I changed "reads" to "takes". Check -->
pyGeo also takes the design variables a user might have defined in the ESP or OpenVSP model.
For ESP and OpenVSP models, the pyGeo interface to the respective software stores the model in a form usable within the MACH framework and updates it as design variables are changed throughout the optimization.
The pyGeo interface to ESP was used by [@Brelje2021a] to parameterize hydrogen tanks (\autoref{fig:esp_example}) that were packaged within an aircraft wing as part of an aerostructural optimization.
pyGeo's OpenVSP interface was used to parameterize the full aircraft configuration (\autoref{fig:vsp_example}) studied in the aeropropulsive optimization work in [@Yildirim2022a].

### Class Shape Transformation

The class shape transformation (CST) methodology [@Kulfan2008] is a popular airfoil parameterization.
It generates a shape using Bernstein polynomials to scale a class function, which is most often a base airfoil shape.
The class function is modified with two parameters, and the number of Bernstein polynomials is adjustable.
pyGeo contains a module that implements this airfoil parameterization.
The implementation supports design variables for the Bernstein polynomial weightings, the class function parameters, and the airfoil chord length.
<!-- SS: We don't mention derivatives for each method, so I'm commenting the following line out. -->
<!-- It includes methods to analytically compute derivatives of the airfoil's surface coordinates with respect to the design variables, which is useful for gradient-based optimization. -->
pyGeo's CST implementation can only be used for 2D problems, such as airfoil optimization (\autoref{fig:cst_example}).

![Airfoil defined by three CST coefficients on each surface undergoing a perturbation in one Bernstein polynomial. \label{fig:cst_example}](cst_example.pdf)

## Constraints

pyGeo also includes geometric constraints.
<!--
Constraints are all differentiated in order to use within gradient-based optimization.
DVCon creates constraint objects which are passed to pyOptSparse.
-->
To set up a constraint, pyGeo needs a grid of points and a normal direction in which to project these points onto the geometry.
Some commonly used geometric constraints in shape optimization are thickness, area, and volume constraints.
Thickness constraints control the distance between two points to prevent excessive local deformations.
<!-- [] TODO SS-: Almost all the constraints can be described by the line below. Should this section focus on why these constraints are useful or just describe them generally? -->
<!-- HMH: Neil suggested listing more of the constraints we use, I think we could also outline why they are useful but if we are short on words that could be tricky -->
<!-- MM: see my attempt in that direction here. -->
Area and volume constraints control the 2D and 3D integrated values of this point set respectively.
<!-- MM: Maybe we can add two sentences here describing the different area constraints and how the volume is integrated, then link to picture-->
All three types constrain the geometry from deviating from the initial design by either a relative or absolute measure.

<!-- list out more constraints -->
<!-- Triangulated surface constraint -->
<!-- [] TODO SS-: Add pictures of some of these constraints? -->
<!-- HMH: working on a figure for thickness and volume constrints -->

# Parallelism
pyGeo can optionally work under distributed memory parallelism with MPI, which can be helpful when interfacing with CFD applications.
For example, the computational mesh may be partitioned and distributed among many processors, and each processor may be aware of only its portion of the mesh.
pyGeo can handle such scenarios by independently manipulating the geometry on each processor and aggregating the constraints across all processors when communicating with the optimizer.

# Derivative Computation
In addition to geometry manipulation and constraints, pyGeo can compute derivatives of these operations with respect to design variables.
For the geometric deformation, pyGeo can compute the Jacobian
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d}X_s}{\mathrm{d}x} ,
\end{equation*}
where $X_s$ is the vector of surface mesh coordinates, and $x$ is the vector of geometric design variables.

Similarly, pyGeo can compute the constraint Jacobian
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d}g}{\mathrm{d}x} ,
\end{equation*}
where $g$ is the vector of geometric constraints.

For the FFD parameterization, these derivatives are computed using a combination of analytic methods [@Martins2021] and the complex-step method [@Martins2003a].
For the interfaces to OpenVSP and ESP, the derivatives are computed with parallel finite differences. 
<!-- [] TODO SS-: Should we mention how derivatives for other methods are computed? -->
<!-- HMH: my thought is no because then we'd have to mention finite differences but I'd rather leave FFD out than have that be the only one mentioned -->
<!-- MM: what's wrong with FD? we could just add ", while other methods rely on finite differences" to the sentence above and wrap it-->
<!-- okay fine -->

# Statement of Need
Few open-source packages exist with comparable functionalities.
To the authors' best knowledge, the only other optimization framework that contains geometry parameterization is the CFD framework SU2 [@Economon2016a].
It supports Hicks--Henne bump functions [@Hicks1978] for airfoil optimizations and the FFD method for three-dimensional cases.
However, it cannot be used with other solvers because it is tightly integrated into the CFD solver.


Both OpenVSP and ESP can be used directly in optimization without using pyGeo, but these parameterization methods lack capabilities needed for high-fidelity MDO when used as stand-alone tools.
pyGeo fills in these gaps through parallelism, efficient gradients, and geometric constraints.
It keeps OpenVSP and ESP in the optimization loop and provides an interface to the tools so they can be used with external solvers.
<!-- % [ ] TODO JM-: check "external" rephrasing above -->

pyGeo has been used extensively in aerodynamic and aerostructural optimizations in aircraft, hydrofoil, and wind turbine applications.
<!-- [] TODO SS-: We should add a few citations for the basic FFD functionality. -->
<!-- HMH: Any ideas on which would be representative? Neil suggested uCRM, maybe we want a wind turbine and/or hydrofoil paper as well for ~range~  -->
<!-- MM: we can re-use the citations above for non-aircraft examples. For aero stuff, one of the latest Nick Bons' paprs could also be a good fit-->
Its different parametrization options have all been necessary for different optimization problems, depending on the geometry involved.
The interface to ESP made it possible to parameterize hydrogen tanks within a combined aerostructural and packaging optimization [@Brelje2021a].
pyGeo's OpenVSP interface was used in the aeropropulsive optimization of a podded electric turbofan [@Yildirim2021c].
The implementation of CST airfoil parameterization was used to compare methods for airfoil optimization [@Adler2022c].
The method for using multiple FFD volumes has been used to optimize a conventional aircraft [@Yildirim2021b], a T-shaped hydrofoil [@Liao2022], and a supersonic transport aircraft [@Seraj2022a].
<!-- [] TODO JM-: Need to end with an overarching statement summarizing what is now possible with this -->

class DVGeoSketch(BaseDVGeometry):
    """A class for manipulating parametric geometry

    The purpose of the BaseDVGeoSketchy class is to provide translation
    of the ESP/OpenVSP geometry engine to externally supplied surfaces. This
    allows the use of ESP/OpenVSP design variables to control the MACH
    framework.

    There are several import limitations:

    1. Since ESP and OpenVSP are surface based only, they cannot be used to
    parameterize a geometry that doesn't lie on the surface. This
    means it cannot be used for structural analysis. It is generally
    possible use most of the constraints DVConstraints since most of
    those points lie on the surface.

    2. It cannot handle *moving* intersection. A geometry with static
    intersections is fine as long as the intersection doesn't move

    3. It does not support complex numbers for the complex-step method.

    4. It does not support separate configurations.

    5. Because of limitations with ESP and OpenVSP, this class
    uses parallel finite differencing to obtain the required Jacobian
    matrices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fileName : str
       filename of .vsp3 file (OpenVSP) or .csm file (ESP).

    comm : MPI Intra Comm
       Comm on which to build operate the object. This is used to
       perform embarrassingly parallel finite differencing. Defaults to
       MPI.COMM_WORLD.

    scale : float
       A global scale factor from the ESP/VSP geometry to incoming (CFD) mesh
       geometry. For example, if the ESP/VSP model is in inches, and the CFD
       in meters, scale=0.0254.

class DVConstraints:
    """DVConstraints provides a convenient way of defining geometric
    constraints for wings. This can be very useful for a constrained
    aerodynamic or aerostructural optimization. Three types of
    constraints are supported:

    1. Thickness 'tooth-pick' constraints: Thickness constraints are
       enforced at specific locations. A relative or absolute
       minimum/maximum thickness can be specified. Two variants are
       supplied: a '2d' variant for thickness constraints over an area
       such as a spar box :func:`addThicknessConstraints2D` and a '1d'
       variant for thickness constraints along a (poly) line
       :func:`addThicknessConstraints1D`.

    2. Volume constraint: This computes and enforces a volume constraint
       over the specified domain. The input is identical to the '2d'
       thickness constraints. See :func:`addVolumeConstraint`.

    3. LE/TE Constraints: These geometric constraints are required when
       using FFD volumes with shape variables. The leading and trailing
       edges must be fixed wrt the shape variables so these enforce that the
       coefficients on the leading edge can only move in equal and opposite
       directions

    4. Fixed Location Constraints: These constraints allow you to specify
       certain location in the FFD that can not move.

    5. Gear Post Constraint: This is a very highly specialized
       constraint used to ensure there is sufficient vertical space to
       install wing-mounted landing gear and that it is correctly positioned
       relative to the wing. See the class definition for more information.

    Analytic sensitivity information is computed for all functions and a
    facility for adding the constraints automatically to a pyOptSparse
    optimization problem is also provided.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        A name for this object. Used to distinguish between DVCon objects
        if multiple DVConstraint objects are used in an optimization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        surf : pyGeo object or list or str
            The triangulated surface representation to use for projections.
            There are a few possible ways of defining a surface.
            1) A pyGeo surface object. `surfFormat` must be "point-vector".
            2) List of [p0, v1, v2] with `surfFormat` "point-vector".
            3) List of [p0, p1, p2] with `surfFormat` "point-point".
            4) Path to a PLOT3D surface file. `surfFormat` must be "point-vector".

            Option 2 is the most common, where the list is computed by an AeroSolver like ADflow.

        addToDVGeo : bool
            Flag to embed the surface point set in a DVGeo object.
            If True, `DVGeoName` must be set appropriately.

        name : str
            Name associated with the surface. Must be unique. For backward compatibility,
            the name is 'default' by default

        DVGeoName : str
            Name of the DVGeo object to set the surface to. You only
            need to set this if you're using multiple DVGeo objects
            for a problem. For backward compatibility, the name is 'default' by default

        surfFormat : str
            The surface format. Either "point-vector" or "point-point".
            See `surf` for details.

        Things to consider:

        * The region given by leList and teList must lie completely
          inside the wing

        * The number of points in leList and teList do not need to be
          the same length.

        * The leading and trailing edges are approximated using
          2-order splines (line segments) and nSpan points are
          interpolated in a linear fashion. For integer nSpan, the thickness
          constraint may not correspond *exactly* to intermediate
          locations in leList and teList. In the example above,
          with len(leList)=3 and nSpan=3, the three thickness
          constraints on the leading edge of the 2D domain would be at
          the left and right boundaries, and at the point denoted by
          'o' which is equidistant between the root and tip.
          To match intermediate locations exactly, pass a list for nSpan.

        * If a curved leading or trailing edge domain is desired,
          simply pass in lists for leList and teList with a sufficient
          number of points that can be approximated with straight line
          segments.

        * The two-dimensional data is projected onto the surface along
          the normals of the ruled surface formed by leList and teList

        * Normally, leList and teList are in given such that the the two curves
          entirely lie in a plane. This ensure that the projection vectors
          are always exactly normal to this plane.

        * If the surface formed by leList and teList is NOT precisely
          normal, issues can arise near the end of an open surface (ie
          root of a single wing) which can result in failing
          intersections.

        Parameters
        ----------
        leList : list or array
            A list or array of points (size should be (Nx3) where N is
            at least 2) defining the 'leading edge' or the start of the
            domain.

        teList : list or array
           Same as leList but for the trailing edge.

        nSpan : int or list of int
            The number of thickness constraints to be (linear)
            interpolated *along* the leading and trailing edges.
            A list of length N-1 can be used to specify the number
            for each segment defined by leList and teList and
            precisely match intermediate locations.

        nChord : int
            The number of thickness constraints to be (linearly)
            interpolated between the leading and trailing edges.

        lower : float or array of size (nSpan x nChord)
            The lower bound for the constraint. A single float will
            apply the same bounds to all constraints, while the array
            option will use different bounds for each constraint.

        upper : float or array of size (nSpan x nChord)
            The upper bound for the constraint. A single float will
            apply the same bounds to all constraints, while the array
            option will use different bounds for each constraint.

        scaled : bool
            Flag specifying whether or not the constraint is to be
            implemented in a scaled fashion or not.

            * scaled=True: The initial length of each thickness
              constraint is defined to be 1.0. In this case, the lower
              and upper bounds are given in multiple of the initial
              length. lower=0.85, upper=1.15, would allow for 15%
              change in each direction from the original length. For
              aerodynamic shape optimizations, this option is used
              most often.

            * scaled=False: No scaling is applied and the physical lengths
              must be specified for the lower and upper bounds.

        scale : float or array of size (nSpan x nChord)

            This is the optimization scaling of the
            constraint. Typically this parameter will not need to be
            changed. If the thickness constraints are scaled, this
            already results in well-scaled constraint values, and
            scale can be left at 1.0. If scaled=False, it may changed
            to a more suitable value of the resulting physical
            thickness have magnitudes vastly different than O(1).

        name : str
            Normally this does not need to be set. Only use this if
            you have multiple DVCon objects and the constraint names
            need to be distinguished **or** the values are to be used
            in a subsequent computation.

        addToPyOpt : bool
            Normally this should be left at the default of True. If
            the values need to be processed (modified) *before* they are
            given to the optimizer, set this flag to False.

        surfaceName : str
            Name of the surface to project to. This should be the same
            as the surfaceName provided when setSurface() was called.
            For backward compatibility, the name is 'default' by default.

        DVGeoName : str
            Name of the DVGeo object to compute the constraint with. You only
            need to set this if you're using multiple DVGeo objects
            for a problem. For backward compatibility, the name is 'default' by default

        compNames : list
            If using DVGeometryMulti, the components to which the point set associated
            with this constraint should be added.
            If None, the point set is added to all components.

        Add a set of leading edge radius constraints. The constraint is set up
        similar to the 1D thickness or thickness-to-chord constraints. The user
        provides a polyline near the leading edge and specifies how many
        locations should be sampled along the polyline. The sampled points are
        then projected to the upper and lower surface along the provided axis.
        A third projection is made to the leading edge along chordDir. We then
        compute the radius of the circle circumscribed by these three points.

        In order for this radius calculation to be a reasonable approximation
        for the actual leading edge radius, it is critical that the polyline be
        drawn very close to the leading edge (less than 0.5% chord). We include
        a check to make sure that the points fall on the same hemisphere of the
        circumscribed circle, however we recommend that the user export the
        Tecplot view of the constraint using the writeTecplot function to verify
        that the circles do coincide with the leading edge radius.

        Parameters
        ----------
        leList : list or array of size (N x 3) where N >=2
            The list of points forming a poly-line along which the
            thickness constraints will be added.

        nSpan : int
            The number of thickness constraints to add. If nSpan is provided
            as -1, then leList is used directly and the number of radius
            constraints will be equal to the number of points in leList

        axis : list or array of length 3
            The direction along which the up-down projections will occur.
            Typically this will be y or z axis ([0,1,0] or [0,0,1])

        chordDir : list or array or length 3
            The vector pointing from the leList to the leading edge. This will
            typically be the negative xaxis ([-1,0,0]). The magnitude of the
            vector doesn't matter, but the direction does.

        lower : float or array of size nSpan
            The lower bound for the constraint. A single float will
            apply the same bounds to all constraints, while the array
            option will use different bounds for each constraint.

        upper : float or array of size nSpan
            The upper bound for the constraint. A single float will
            apply the same bounds to all constraints, while the array
            option will use different bounds for each constraint.

        scaled : bool
            Flag specifying whether or not the constraint is to be
            implemented in a scaled fashion or not.

            * scaled=True: The initial radius of each constraint is defined to
              be 1.0. In this case, the lower and upper bounds are given in
              multiples of the initial radius. lower=0.85, upper=1.15, would
              allow for 15% change in each direction from the original radius.

            * scaled=False: No scaling is applied and the physical radii
              must be specified for the lower and upper bounds.

        scale : float or array of size nSpan
            This is the optimization scaling of the constraint. Typically this
            parameter will not need to be changed. If the radius constraints are
            scaled, this already results in well-scaled constraint values, and
            scale can be left at 1.0. If scaled=False, it may  be changed to a
            more suitable value if the resulting physical thickness have
            magnitudes vastly different than O(1).

        name : str
            Normally this does not need to be set. Only use this if you have
            multiple DVCon objects and the constraint names need to be
            distinguished **or** you are using this set of thickness constraints
            for something other than a direct constraint in pyOptSparse.

        addToPyOpt : bool
            Normally this should be left at the default of True. If
            the values need to be processed (modified) *before* they are
            given to the optimizer, set this flag to False.

            Name of the surface to project to. This should be the same
            as the surfaceName provided when setSurface() was called.
            For backward compatibility, the name is 'default' by default.

            Name of the DVGeo object to compute the constraint with. You only
            need to set this if you're using multiple DVGeo objects
            for a problem. For backward compatibility, the name is 'default' by default

            If using DVGeometryMulti, the components to which the point set associated
            with this constraint should be added.
            If None, the point set is added to all components.

        ptList : list or array of size (N x 3) where N >=2
            The list of points forming a poly-line along which the
            points will be fixed.

        nCon : int
            The number of points constraints to add

        lower : float or array of size nCon
            The lower bound for the constraint. A single float will
            apply the same bounds to all constraints, while the array
            option will use different bounds for each constraint. If
            no value is provided, the bounds will default to the points,
            giving equality constraints. Using the default is recommended.

        upper : float or array of size nCon

        scaled : bool
            Flag specifying whether or not the constraint is to be
            implemented in a scaled fashion or not.

            * scaled=True: The initial location of each location
              constraint is defined to be 1.0. In this case, the lower
              and upper bounds are given in multiple of the initial
              location. lower=0.85, upper=1.15, would allow for 15%
              change in each direction from the original location. However,
              for initial points close to zero this blows up, so this should

              must be specified for the lower and upper bounds.

        scale : float or array of size nCon
            This is the optimization scaling of the
            constraint. Typically this parameter will not need to be

        Parameters
        ----------
        ptList : list or array of size (N x 3) where N >=2
            The list of points forming a poly-line along which the
            thickness constraints will be added.

        nCon : int
            The number of thickness to chord ratio constraints to add

        axis : list or array of length 3
            The direction along which the projections will occur.
            Typically this will be y or z axis ([0,1,0] or [0,0,1])

        chordDir : list or array or length 3
            The direction defining "chord". This will typically be the
            xasis ([1,0,0]). The magnitude of the vector doesn't
            matter.

        lower : float or array of size nCon

            The lower bound for the constraint. A single float will
            apply the same bounds to all constraints, while the array
            option will use different bounds for each constraint. This
            constraint can only be used in "scaled" mode. That means,
            the actual t/c is *never* computed. This constraint can
            only be used to constrain the relative change in t/c. A
            lower bound of 1.0, therefore mean the t/c cannot
            decrease. This is the typical use of this constraint.

        upper : float or array of size nCon
            The upper bound for the constraint. A single float will
            apply the same bounds to all constraints, while the array
            option will use different bounds for each constraint.

        scale : float or array of size nCon
            This is the optimization scaling of the
            constraint. Typically this parameter will not need to be
            changed. If the thickness constraints are scaled, this
            already results in well-scaled constraint values, and
            scale can be left at 1.0. If scaled=False, it may changed
            to a more suitable value of the resulting physical
            thickness have magnitudes vastly different than O(1).

        name : str
            Normally this does not need to be set. Only use this if
            you have multiple DVCon objects and the constraint names
            need to be distinguished **or** you are using this set of
            thickness constraints for something other than a direct
            constraint in pyOptSparse.

            Normally this should be left at the default of True. If
            the values need to be processed (modified) *before* they are
            given to the optimizer, set this flag to False.

            Name of the DVGeo object to compute the constraint with. You only
            need to set this if you're using multiple DVGeo objects
            for a problem. For backward compatibility, the name is 'default' by default

            The name of the DVGeo object to associate surface_1 to.

            The name of the second triangulated surface to constrain.

        rho : float
            The rho factor of the KS function of min distance.

        heuristic_dist : float

            pairs of facets that are farther apart than a heuristic distance
            in order to save computation time. By default, this is set
            to the maximum linear dimension of the second object's bounding box.
            You can set this to a large number to compute an "exact" KS.

        Parameters
        ----------
        leList : list or array
           A list or array of points (size should be (Nx3) where N is
           at least 2) defining the 'leading edge' or the start of the
           domain.

        teList : list or array
           Same as leList but for the trailing edge.

        nSpan : int or list of int
            The number of projected points to be (linear)
            interpolated *along* the leading and trailing edges.
            A list of length N-1 can be used to specify the number
            for each segment defined by leList and teList and
            precisely match intermediate locations.

        nChord : int
            The number of projected points to be (linearly)
            interpolated between the leading and trailing edges.

        lower : float
            The lower bound for the volume constraint.

        upper : float
            The upper bound for the volume constraint.

        scaled : bool
            Flag specifying whether or not the constraint is to be

            ``faceID`` (one of ``ilow``, ``ihigh``, ``jlow``, ``jhigh``, ``klow``, or
            ``khigh``). This it the preferred approach. Both ``volID`` and ``faceID``
            can be determined by examining the FFD file in TecPlot or ICEM.
            Use 'prob data' tool in TecPlot to click on the surface of which
            you want to put constraints on (e.g. the front or LE of FFD and
            the back surface or TE of the FFD). You will see which plane
            it coresponding to. For example, 'I-Plane' with I-index = 1 is
            ``iLow``.
            ``topID`` provides a second input for blocks that have 2x2 faces.
        ``indSetA`` and ``indSetB``
            Alternatively, two sets of indices can be provided.
            Both must be the same length. These indices may
            be obtained from the ``lindex`` array of the FFD object.

                >>> lIndex = DVGeo.getLocalIndex(iVol)

            ``lIndex`` is a three dimensional set of indices that provide the
            index into the global set of control points. See below for
            examples.

        .. note::
            These constraints *will* be added to pyOptSparse automatically with a call to
            :func:`addConstraintsPyOpt`

        Parameters
        ----------
        volID : int
            Single integer specifying the volume index
        faceID : str {'iLow', 'iHigh', 'jLow', 'jHigh', 'kLow', 'kHigh'}
            One of above specifying the node on which face to constrain.
        topID : str {'i','j', 'k'}
            One of the above specifing the symmetry direction, should
            only be used on 2x2 faces
        indSetA : array of int
            Indices of control points on one side of the FFD
        indSetB : array of int
            Indices of control points on the *other* side of the FFD
        name : str
            Normally this does not need to be set; a default name will
            be generated automatically. Only use this if you have
            multiple DVCon objects and the constraint names need to
            be distinguished
        config : str
            The DVGeo configuration to apply this constraint to. Must be either None
            which will apply to *ALL* the local DV groups or a single string specifying
            a particular configuration.
        childIdx : int
            The zero-based index of the child FFD, if this constraint is being applied to a child FFD.
            The index is defined by the order in which you add the child FFD to the parent.
            For example, the first child FFD has an index of 0, the second an index of 1, and so on.
        comp: str
            The component name if using DVGeometryMulti.

        optimization. As it turns out, this is a critical constraint
        for wing-mounted landing gear and high-aspect ratio swept
        wings. This constraint actually encompasses *two*
        optimization constraints:

        1. The first is a physical depth constraint that uses DVCon's
        built in thickness constraint class.

        2. The second constraint is that the x-position of the the
        gear post as a fraction of the wing MAC must be greater than
        MACFracLower which will typically be 50%.

        The calculation uses a wimpressCalc object to determine the
        nominal trapezodial planform to determine the MAC and the
        LE-MAC.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wimpressCalc : wimpressCalc class
            An instance of the wimpress calc class. This is required for
            computing the MAC and the xLEMac

        position : array of size 3
            Three dimensional position of the gear post constraint.

        axis : array of size 3
            Direction to perform projection. Same as 'axis'
            in addThicknessConstraints1D

        thickLower : float
            Lower bound for thickness constraint. If thickScaled=True,
            this is the physical distance scaled by the initial length.
            This value is used as the optimization constraint lower bound.

        thickUpper : float
            Upper bound for optimization constraint. See thickLower.

        thickScaled : bool
            Flag specifying if the constraint should be scaled.
            It is true by default. The default values of thickScaled=True,
            thickLower=1.0, ensures that the initial thickness does not
            decrease.

        MACFracLower : float
            The desired lower bound for the gear post location as a
            fraction of MAC. Default is 0.50

        MACFracUpper : float
            The desired upper bound for the gear post location as a
            fraction of MAC. Default is 0.60

        name : str
            Normally this does not need to be set. Only use this if
            you have multiple DVCon objects and the constraint names
            need to be distinguished **or** the values are to be used
            in a subsequent computation.

        addToPyOpt : bool
            Normally this should be left at the default of True. If
            the values need to be processed (modified) *before* they are
            given to the optimizer, set this flag to False.

        compNames : list
            If using DVGeometryMulti, the components to which the point set associated
            with this constraint should be added.
            If None, the point set is added to all components.

        Add a curvature contraint for the prescribed surface. The only required input for this
        constraint is a structured plot 3D file of the surface (there can be multiple
        surfaces in the file). This value is meant to be corelated with manufacturing costs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        surfFile: vector
            Plot3D file with desired surface, should be sufficiently refined to
            accurately capture surface curvature

        curvatureType: str
            The type of curvature to calculate. Options are: 'Gaussian', 'mean', 'combined', or 'KSmean'.
            Here the Gaussian curvature is K=kappa_1*kappa_2, the mean curvature is H = 0.5*(kappa_1+kappa_2),
            the combined curvature C = kappa_1^2+kappa_2^2=(2*H)^2-2*K, and the KSmean curvature applies the
            KS function to the mean curvature, which is essentially the max local mean curvature on the prescribed
            surface. In practice, we compute the squared integrated value over the surface, e.g., sum(H*H*dS), for the
            Gaussian, mean and combined curvatures. While for the KSmean, we applied the KS function, i.e., KS(H*H*dS)

        lower : float
            Lower bound for curvature integral.

        upper : float
            Upper bound for optimization constraint. See lower.

        scale : float
            This is the optimization scaling of the
            constraint. Typically this parameter will not need to be
            changed. If scaled=True, this automatically results in a
            well-scaled constraint and scale can be left at 1.0. If
            scaled=False, it may changed to a more suitable value of
            the resulting physical volume magnitude is vastly different
            from O(1).

        scaled : bool
            Flag specifying whether or not the constraint is to be
            implemented in a scaled fashion or not.

            * scaled=True: The initial curvature is defined to be 1.0.
              In this case, the lower and upper bounds are given in
              multiple of the initial curvature. lower=0.85, upper=1.15,
              would allow for 15% change in curvature both upper and
              lower. For aerodynamic optimization, this is the most
              widely used option .

            * scaled=False: No scaling is applied and the physical
              curvature. lower and upper refer to the physical curvatures.

        KSCoeff : float
            The coefficient for KS function when curvatureType=KSmean.
            This controls how close the KS function approximates the original
            functions. One should select a KSCoeff such that the printed "Reference curvature"
            is only slightly larger than the printed "Max curvature" for the baseline surface.
            The default value of KSCoeff is the number of points in the plot3D files.

        name : str
             Normally this does not need to be set; a default name will
             be generated automatically. Only use this if you have
             multiple DVCon objects and the constraint names need to
             be distinguished **OR** you are using this volume
             computation for something other than a direct constraint
             in pyOpt, i.e. it is required for a subsequent
             computation.

        addToPyOpt : bool
            Normally this should be left at the default of False if the
            cost is part of the objective. If the integral is to be
            used directly as a constraint, addToPyOpt should be True, and name
            specified to a logical name for this computation. with
            addToPyOpt=False, the lower, upper and scale variables are
            meaningless

        compNames : list
            If using DVGeometryMulti, the components to which the point set associated
            with this constraint should be added.
            If None, the point set is added to all components.

          The '+' are the (three dimensional) points defined by 'start' and 'end'. Once the straightline
          is defined, we generate nPts-2 intermediate points along it and project these points to the design
          surface mesh in the prescirbed axis direction. Here 'x' are the intermediate points added by setting
          nPts = 9. The curvature will be calculated based on the projected intermediate points (x) on the design
          surface.

        .. note::
           We do not calculate the curvatures at the two end points (+).
           So make sure to extend the start and end points a bit to fully cover the area where you want to compute the curvature

        Parameters
        ----------
        start/end : list of size 3

        axis : list of size 3
            The direction along which the projections will occur.

Installation
============

To install, first clone the repo, then go into the root directory and type::

   pip install .

The tests require unique dependencies ``numpy-stl`` and ``parameterized``.
These and additional, generic, testing dependencies can be installed by using::
    
    pip install .[testing]

For stability we recommend cloning or checking out a tagged release.

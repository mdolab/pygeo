*Shape optimization* is a field of engineering which uses applied mathematics and computer simulation to find the best possible shape for an object, such as an aircraft or a ship.
In order to do this, optimization software needs to perturb a baseline geometry into a new shape at each iteration.
Users define *design variables* which map numeric inputs from the optimizer to changes in the geometry.

Examples of geometry design variables might include:

- Span, aspect ratio, or sweep in a wing design problem
- Freeboard, deadrise, and beam for a ship design problem
- Blade length, twist distribution, and airfoil shape modes for a wind turbine problem

The set of all geometry design variables and their effects on the baseline geometry is called a *parameterization*.
Parameterizations are not unique, and choosing a good one is both an art and a science.

There are two primary approaches to geometry parameterization: generative and deformative.
In pyGeo, we primarily use a free form deformation (FFD) approach, which is deformative.
A deformative parameterization does not require as detailed of a parameterization as a generative approach, such as CAD, does.
This relative simplicity is beneficial for implementation of the parameterization itself and the corresponding sensitivity analysis.

Some geometries that can be generated by a parameterization are not allowable for physical or other engineering reasons.
For this reason, *geometry constraints* must often also be imposed (such as a minimum volume inside a car's cabin, or a wing thickness).

``pyGeo`` enables users to set up a variety of geometric parameterizations and geometry constraints.
It is particularly useful for *gradient-based* optimization because it provides accurate derivatives of geometry with respect to the design variables.

Package Description
-------------------

The package consists of the following high-level modules:

- **DVGeometry** (short for "Design Variable Geometry") parameterizes and modifies geometry (point sets) in shape optimization problems, using the Free Form Deformation (FFD) method.
- **DVGeometryESP** enables CAD-based geometry parameterization using Engineering Sketch Pad (ESP) software
- **DVGeometryVSP** enables conceptual geometry parameterization using the Vehicle Sketch Pad (OpenVSP) software
- **DVConstraints** allows users to constrain important geometric parameters during optimization (such as thicknesses and volumes)
- **pyGeo** generates spline surfaces, either from geometry files, or *ab initio* wing surfaces.

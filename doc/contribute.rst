A general guide to contributing to MDO Lab codes, including bug reports, coding style, and pull requests, can be found :doc:`here <mach-aero:machFramework/contribute>`. 
pyGeo does require additional packages to run tests, information on which can be found on the :ref:`installation page <install>` in these docs.
